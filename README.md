AI-Powered Debugging Assistant
Overview
This project is an AI-enhanced debugging assistant that scans C++ code, detects syntax and logical errors, and provides AI-based insights for optimization. It leverages C++, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve debugging efficiency.
Features
•	Reads C++ source code from files
•	Detects common syntax errors using regular expressions
•	AI-powered code analysis (TensorFlow integration for future enhancements)
•	Command-line interface (CLI) for easy usage
•	Scalable and modular design
Tech Stack
•	C++ (Core implementation)
•	TensorFlow C API (For AI-based analysis, planned integration)
•	OpenCV (For code pattern recognition, planned integration)
•	Regular Expressions (For syntax validation)
Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
2.	git clone (https://github.com/MrDoVersaworks/AI-Powered-Debugging-Assistant/tree/65b3648ed3d201fc967b3f77dd6ac487215a0c44)
3.	Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang).
4.	Compile the program:
g++ -o debugger assistant.cpp -ltensorflow
5.	Run the program:
./debugger sample_code.cpp
Usage
Pass any C++ source file as an argument:
./debugger my_code.cpp
Output will include syntax warnings and AI-powered analysis.
Example Output
Possible syntax issue detected: Missing semicolon.
AI Analysis: Code follows general best practices, but optimization needed.
Future Enhancements
•	Full integration with TensorFlow for deep learning-based debugging.
•	Enhanced error classification for better bug detection.
•	Visual debugging support using OpenCV.
