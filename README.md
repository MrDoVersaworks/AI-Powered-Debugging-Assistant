AI-Powered Debugging Assistant
Overview
The AI-Powered Debugging Assistant is a C++ tool designed to analyze C++ source code, detect common bugs, and suggest fixes. It leverages Clang for static analysis, OpenCV for potential code visualization, TensorFlow for AI-driven debugging insights, and OpenAI's API for NLP-based error interpretation.
Features
•	Automated Bug Detection: Uses Clang to scan source code and identify syntax errors, memory leaks, and other common issues.
•	NLP-Based Error Analysis: Integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide human-like explanations and debugging insights.
•	AI-Powered Fix Suggestions: Suggests code fixes based on error patterns.
•	TensorFlow Model Integration: Uses deep learning to recognize and classify common C++ bugs.
Tech Stack
•	C++ (Core Language)
•	OpenCV (Potential code visualization)
•	TensorFlow (Machine Learning)
•	Clang API (Static Code Analysis)
•	nlohmann/json (JSON parsing)
•	cURL (HTTP requests for OpenAI API)
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
•	C++ Compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
•	OpenCV (sudo apt install libopencv-dev on Ubuntu)
•	TensorFlow C API (sudo apt install tensorflow-dev)
•	Clang (sudo apt install clang)
•	cURL (sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev)
•	nlohmann/json (sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev)
Cloning the Repository
git clone https://github.com/MrDoVersaworks/AI-Powered-Debugging-Assistant.git
cd AI-Powered-Debugging-Assistant
Compiling the Code
g++ -o debug_assistant main.cpp -lclang -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -ltensorflow -lcurl -std=c++17
Usage
Run the assistant with a C++ source file as input:
./debug_assistant your_source_file.cpp
Example Output:
Clang Diagnostic: ‘std::vector’ is missing ‘#include <vector>’
Suggested Fix: Try adding `#include <vector>` at the beginning of your file.
Configuration
OpenAI API Key Setup
To use OpenAI’s NLP analysis, add your API key in analyzeErrorWithOpenAI function:
headers = curl_slist_append(headers, "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY");
